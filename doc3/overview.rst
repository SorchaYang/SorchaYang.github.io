Overview
========

The python package Scopy(Screnning COmpounds in PYthon) is designed by `CBDD Group`_ (Computational Biology & Drug Design Group), Xiangya School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Central South University. The noise, existed in compound library, may interfere the screening result, so called False Positive. To help select quality hit compounds, a filter is necessary before screenig and(or) purchasing. Scopy is a such filter that can not only analyse the physicochemical (PC) properties and filter compounds based on PC-derived rules, but search for the presence of toxicophores (potentially toxic chemical groups). Scopy can also flag unwanted reactive chemical groups, e.g. Pan Assay Interference Compounds (PAINS) or aggregators Our aims at enhancing the chances of finding compounds with an acceptable absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) profile. Roughly, there are 41 PC properties and 15 PC-derived rules to be analysed. Besides, Scopy also contains 2,167 unexpected groups  covering 21 endpoints. In addtion, 7 fingerprints retrieved from fragments are supplied.

Who uses Scopy?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For those researchers from different biomedical fields, the Scopy package can be used to enhance the chance of finding compounds with an acceptable ADMET profile. Scopy will be helpful when finding the method to reduce the space of compound space.

 
Motivation
~~~~~~~~~~
Scopy is intended to provide

-  Analyse the physicochemical (PC) properties and filter compounds based on PC-derived rules
   
-  Search for the presence of toxicophores
   
-  Flag unwanted reactive chemical groups

-  Compute fingerprints retrieved from fragments

-  Provide an intuitive visualization
   
Feature overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Scopy cantain five parts: **drug-likeness filter** to analyse the physicochemical (PC) properties and filter compounds based on PC-derived rules, **structure alert filter** to search for the presence of toxicophores and flag unwanted reactive chemical groups, **fingerprints calulater** to compute fingerprints retrieved from fragments, **visualization tool** to provide an intuitive visualization, **pretreat** to solve some molecules can not be recognize. The table beblow shows each the detail of each part. Roughly, there are 41 PC properties and 15 PC-derived rules to be analysed. Besides, Scopy also contains 2,167 unexpected groups  covering 21 endpoints. In addtion, 7 fingerprints retrieved from fragments are supplied.

The Python programming language
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python is a powerful programming language that allows simple and flexible representations of biochemical molecules, and clear and concise expressions of bioinformatics algorithms. Python has a vibrant and growing ecosystem of packages that PyBioMed uses to provide more features such as RDkit and Pybel. In addition, Python is also an excellent “glue” language for putting together pieces of software from other languages which allows reuse of legacy code and engineering of high-performance algorithms. Equally important, Python is free, well-supported, and a joy to use. In order to make full use of PyBioMed, you will want to know how to write basic programs in Python. Among the many guides to Python, we recommend the documentation at http://www.python.org.
